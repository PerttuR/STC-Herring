AIM 1 source FDI:

where and when each metier is catching herring in Baltic (Between countries)
-set metier threshold landings
-"all trawlers in each metier more than 5%" in total by year? (Areas: all Baltic, northern Northsea??, Skagerrag & Kattegat) 
-Norway is not in FDI. Different source..should be publicly available. Florian might know?
-FDI data 2013-2023 is available 2024 will be at the end of 2025

GOAL -> to map fishing activity in space and time.
FOR -> 
WP1.3 to identify scenarios (timeline: BY: Q3 = end of September)
and 
WP3 to select relevant vessels for modelling based on these overviews (BY: Q3 = end of September) 


- which table A, G, H, I ?
Table A is good to identify Fleets and to begin with.

H and I for ICES Rectangle level outputs

- tables / diagrams?
Needed for identifying the fleets.
